# Development Commands and Server Management

## Critical Development Rules

### ⚠️ Always Use `npm start` for Development

- **NEVER** use `npm run dev` alone - this only runs Eleventy without CSS compilation
- **ALWAYS** use `npm start` which runs both Tailwind CSS watch and Eleventy serve
- This ensures CSS is properly compiled from Tailwind directives

### Server Behavior Understanding

- Development servers run indefinitely until manually stopped
- When server shows "Watching..." it's working correctly (not hung)
- Server serves site on `http://localhost:8080/`
- Auto-rebuilds on file changes

### Background vs Foreground Commands

When using terminal commands through AI assistance:

- **Background mode** (`is_background: true`): Allows continued conversation
- **Foreground mode** (`is_background: false`): Blocks conversation until completed
- For long-running servers, request background mode: "start the server in the background"

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### CSS Not Loading

1. Check if Tailwind is running: Look for "Done in Xms" messages
2. Verify `_site/css/styles.css` contains compiled CSS, not raw `@tailwind` directives
3. Restart with `npm start` if CSS contains uncompiled directives

#### Layout Errors

- Missing layout files cause build failures
- Ensure all referenced layouts exist in `src/_layouts/`
- Check that `date` filter is defined in [eleventy.config.js](mdc:eleventy.config.js)

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Full development with CSS compilation and live server
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run css:build` - Compile CSS for production
- `npm run css:watch` - Watch and compile CSS only
- `npm run deploy` - Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
