        <p>You'd miss it if you didn't know<br>
        Just a stile in the stone (wall)<br>
        A painted white gate, weathered but<br>
        looking well for its age.<br>
        The slope rises hard –<br>
        Its edges bitten by nettle & briar.<br>
        The steep road, bending like an old man's back</p>

        <p>But climb it, & the world unfurls.<br>
        Carrigtwohill, Cobh, the winding of the harbour –<br>
        East Cork cast out below,<br>
        Stitched & spread like God's own tapestry.<br>
        A gift half-offered then taken back</p>

        <p>In the hush of the graveyard, stones look Least<br>
        Some broken, some worn by time,<br>
        'Some nameless – others perfect.<br>
        Tilting towards the dawn's first breath<br>
        Even the blank slabs<br>
        Lichen-laced, lean to the rising sun.</p>

        <p>Beyond the trees, further away,<br>
        The famine pit lies quiet<br>
        No crosses, no epitaphs –<br>
        Just a shallow dip where the ground remembers<br>
        Hundreds thrown to clay like seed - in sorrow<br>
        A hunger so wide, it swallowed names.<br>
        Now only the wind calls to them</p>

        <p>The air here holds its own litany<br>
        The whistle through the yew & Sycamore<br>
        Rain that falls sideways,<br>
        Soaking into bone & root like memory<br>
        When Sunlight comes<br>
        It breaks sudden & soft<br>
        Grace on limestone shoulders & crooked marble</p>

        <p>Some lie grand in their beds of stone –<br>
        You can tell by the flourish, the pride of cut<br>
        Others left only the suggestion of a name<br>
        The barest curve where chisel once bit</p>

        <p>There are rebels here,<br>
        Blacksmiths, infants<br>
        A farmer in his Sunday coat,<br>
        His boots polished one last time<br>
        They all lie as equals now.<br>
        Whatever pride or troubles they carried,<br>
        Has long been stripped by wind, by moss by time.</p>

        <p>What stays with me<br>
        The hill they would have climbed<br>
        The funeral cart groaning slow<br>
        Wheels gritting the dirt & gravel<br>
        Mourners hunched forward<br>
        As if the hill itself would undo them again</p>

        <p>Just the tread of feet, the hush of grief<br>
        The awful weight of words unspoken<br>
        No coin or curse matters here<br>
        The clay takes Lord & ploughboys the same<br>
        Their dreams are but dust now<br>
        But whispers in the soil</p>

        <p>All that lasts<br>
        Their east-facing stone<br>
        Kissed each morning<br>
        By the dawn's first light</p>
