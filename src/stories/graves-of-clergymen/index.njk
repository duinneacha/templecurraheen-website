        Did you know that clergymen were sometimes buried facing West, rather than East like everyone else? The reason is uncertain, but Templecurraheen holds examples of this tradition.

        One such grave is that of Rev. John O'Neill, Prior of the Carmelite house at Castlelyons, who died on 28th November 1769 at the age of 61. His headstone, which faces westward, reads:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary-300 pl-6 py-4 my-6 bg-primary-50 dark:bg-gray-800 italic">
        "Here lieth the body of the Rev. John O'Neill, Prior of the Carmelite of Castle Lyons who died the 28th November, 1769 aged 61 years."

    <p class="mb-6">
        This inscription confirms that Castlelyons Priory belonged to the Carmelites, not the Dominicans as was once thought. The headstone (K.82) lies beside the Coppinger family tomb. After the Reformation, when the priory was confiscated, Carmelite friars and other priests often found refuge with Catholic gentry families of East Cork, such as the Coppingers — who gave them protection despite the risks.
