    <h1 class="text-3xl font-serif mb-6">The Story of Templecurraheen Graveyard</h1>
    
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Hello there. You're looking at the history of our graveyard, Templecurraheen. I've walked these grounds many times, and every step tells a story of Carrigtwohill's past. From its ancient origins to the present day, this place holds a special spot in the heart of our community.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        This graveyard, perched on a hill with a view of Cork Harbour, is much more than a collection of old stones. It's a living timeline, connecting us to the generations that came before. The name itself, Templecurraheen, is used interchangeably with its original name, Kilcurfin. This tells you all you need to know about its long history. Even as the old church fell into ruin, the community never stopped burying their loved ones here, a powerful sign of our deep, abiding connection to this sacred ground.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">From "The Little Swamp" to Norman Control</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The very name Kilcurfin comes from the old Irish "Cill Coraichín," which means "Church of the Little Swamp." Templecurraheen is thought to come from "Teampallcurrachin," meaning "church on a small patch of boggy land." The similar meanings show how our ancestors understood this land.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        By the late 13th century, Kilcurfin was a working parish church, even appearing on a list of parish churches in 1291. It's believed that Philip de Barry, one of the Norman lords who arrived in Cork in the late 1100s, may have been granted this land. The Normans changed the landscape and brought in their own church system. This meant that small, local churches like ours were brought into a new, bigger system. Kilcurfin went from a local place of worship to a small part of a larger parish, showing how big events can change a small community's history forever.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">The Reformation and the End of the Church</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The Reformation was a turning point for Templecurraheen. With the new Protestant state church in power, Catholic churches and lands were seized. Because there weren't many Protestant families in the area, smaller churches like Kilcurfin weren't kept up. They were left to fall into ruin. This is why today you can still see the crumbling east and north walls of the old church.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        But while the church building was abandoned, the graveyard's purpose never changed. It remained the final resting place for generations of local families. This resilience shows that a community's attachment to its sacred ground can outlast political and religious upheaval.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">People and Stories in Stone</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        Walking through the graveyard, you'll see headstones that speak of those who lived here centuries ago, with some inscriptions dating back to the mid-1700s. Each stone tells its own story — of families, of lives lived and lost, and of the community that has surrounded this place for generations.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        One notable feature is the tomb of the Coppingers of Barryscourt, dated 1788. Their choice to be buried here shows the importance of this site to local families of influence, including those connected to the Barrys of Barryscourt Castle.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        It's worth remembering that while the Barry and Cotter families were prominent in the area, Sir James Cotter's 1688 monument lies not here at Templecurraheen, but in the ruins of St. David's Church, the old Carrigtwohill Church. This reflects the rich and varied history of sacred sites in our parish.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">The Battle of Gortroe and a Modern-Day Hero</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        Templecurraheen holds a special, heartbreaking connection to the Battle of Gortroe, a skirmish from the Tithe War in 1834. It's the final resting place of two brothers, John and Michael Collins, who were killed that day. The fact that they were buried here, in their ancestral plot, rather than the closer Gortroe cemetery, shows how important it was to be buried "with their own people."

    <p class="mb-6">
        Recently, a wonderful thing happened. A local man, Michael Finn, took it upon himself to clean up the graveyard, which had become overgrown and forgotten. His work was a real "Reformation" of the site. Michael, his wife Cora and his family have made the entire graveyard accessible, carefully clearing weeds and recording every single headstone inscription without disturbing the graves. In 2023, as part of this effort, a new inscription was added to the Collins' headstone, ensuring we never forget their story. This kind of community pride and action is what keeps our local history alive.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">A Community's Promise</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        Templecurraheen Graveyard has faced its share of challenges. Before Michael Finn's work, it was almost completely inaccessible. Sadly, we've also had to deal with thoughtless fly-tipping.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        However, as a site that dates to at least the 13th century, Templecurraheen is protected by law. The National Monuments Act ensures that our heritage is safe, and Cork County Council works with local groups like ours to care for these special places. Michael Finn's work is a perfect example of this partnership in action, showing that local passion combined with proper guidance is the best way to protect our past. He's not just "tidying up"—he's preserving the history that's woven into every mound and stone, keeping this place a living part of our heritage.
