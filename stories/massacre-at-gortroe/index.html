        <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 dark:text-gray-400">18th December 1834</p>
    </header>
    
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The Tithe War (1831-1835) was a period of intense social unrest in Ireland, when Irish tenants were forced to give a tenth of their agricultural produce to support the Protestant Church and its ministers. This unjust system led to much disturbance and sometimes bloodshed across the country.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The worst incident of this conflict occurred in the parish of Gortroe/Bartlemy, near Rathcormac on 18th December 1834. On that fateful day, Rev Archdeacon Ryder JP, known locally as 'Black Billy', sought military and police support for the tithe collection. They arrived at the farm of the widow Ryan to find a large hostile crowd of about 200 tenant farmers who had gathered to resist the collection.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        In the resulting confrontation, the military opened fire on the crowd and twelve people were killed. Among the dead were two young brothers named Collins - Mike (30) and John (32) from Carrigtwohill (it is assumed). Both were buried in Templecurraheen Graveyard.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Following the massacre, an inquest was held in which the Jury and Coroner brought in a verdict against those responsible for the shooting. The public outcry was significant, and this pressure helped push parliament to act: a new law reduced tithes by 25% and converted the remainder into a rent charge, marking the beginning of the end for the oppressive tithe system that had caused so much suffering across Ireland.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">The Collins Family Tragedy</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The Collins family headstone in Templecurraheen tells a story of loss across generations. The original inscription reads:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary-300 pl-6 py-4 my-6 bg-primary-50 dark:bg-gray-800 italic">
        "Erected by John Collins, in memory of his father Michael Collins who died 5th August 1832 aged 71 years RIP"
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        Just two years later, tragedy struck again when John Collins had to add a second inscription for his own sons:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary-300 pl-6 py-4 my-6 bg-primary-50 dark:bg-gray-800 italic">
        "His sons John Collins & Michael Collins Died at the Battle of Gortroe Bartlemy 18th December 1834"
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The fact that the Collins brothers were buried in Templecurraheen rather than in a closer cemetery shows the importance of family burial plots and the deep connection families had to their ancestral graveyards, even in times of tragedy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">Aftermath and Impact</h2>
    
    

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">Annual Commemoration</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The memory of those who died at Gortroe is kept alive through an annual commemoration held at the Gortroe monument in Bartlemy. This solemn ceremony honours the victims of the massacre and serves as a reminder of the human cost of social injustice.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The most recent commemoration was held on Wednesday 18th December 2024, marking the 190th anniversary of this tragic event. These annual gatherings ensure that the sacrifice of the Collins brothers and the other victims is never forgotten, and that their story continues to be told to future generations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">A Living Memorial</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        Today, visitors to Templecurraheen Graveyard can see the Collins family headstone and reflect on this dark chapter in Irish history. The graveyard serves as a living memorial not just to the Collins family, but to all those who suffered during the Tithe War and similar periods of social unrest.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The story of the Massacre at Gortroe reminds us that even the smallest communities can be caught up in the great events of history, and that every grave in Templecurraheen has a story that connects to the broader narrative of Ireland's past.
