        This very large prosperous house at Annsgrove, Carrigtwohill was owned by the Cotter Family. Like most large Irish families they had at least one child in the Church – a priest.

        The priest returned one summer for his holidays at home in his Grandfather's large house. One day he was in the large yard and there he met his Grandfather "Old Tom" – his father was called "Young Tom". In the course of their discussions a difference of opinion arose. "Old Tom" used to 'ruling the roost' would not concede an inch in the dispute to his more learned grandson. He got very animated and excited. In his anger lifted his walking stick which he brought down on the head of the priest. The priest fell down but then got up slowly & turned to his Grandfather and issued this decree (curse?). "The day will come when there will not be a Cotter left in Carhoo!" This came to pass after 100 years approximately when the last Cotter died in 1996 and the house fell into disrepair until today it has totally disappeared.

        The other side of this family who lived at Knockmonles, was a more positive story however tragic. Mr James Cotter who while at the seaside in Murphy's Cove, Monatrea on the 9th August 1947 saw a woman frantically entering the water & screaming continuously for "Help!" as her daughter had got into serious trouble while bathing. The woman reached the struggling child but could not bring her back to safety. Mr Cotter who was with his brother-in-law Mr. Ml. Blake did not hesitate to run down to their assistance. He plunged in and reached both but he also despite being a strong swimmer could not get them or himself back out of the very strong current. Others watching by now waded in towards the group and eventually got the little girl to safety. They returned & brought the woman out who unfortunately also died later. However by this time there was no sight or sound or Mr. Cotter. His companion did all he could to get help. He was not a swimmer. The only local phone was out of order having been struck by lightening some time previously. Others ran for help & assistance but all was in vain. He was only 31 years of age and his body was not found until 11.30am the following day very near where he was last seen. He is buried Newestown.

        It was noted at his inquest that there was neither warning notices of Danger in the locality or any life saving apparatus which was the responsibility of the local authorities.
